Hi Lee,

Thanks for the chance to see your slides, and here's some feedback for you.

1. The scales on the y axes on some slides make them hard to compare across regions and species. Suggest using a common y axis for the first look, then adding a figure as needed to hone in on trends where the y scales may be too small to see much change.
2. Slides 18, 19, and 20 - verify that the years are correct in the status row. 

Otherwise this is looking good.

Cheers,
Melissa
