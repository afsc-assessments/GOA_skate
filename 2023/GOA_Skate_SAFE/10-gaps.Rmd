# Data Gaps and Research Priorities

A full description of the data gaps and research priorities can be found in the 2021 GOA skate assessment [@Ormseth2021_skate_assessment]. What follows is an abbreviation from the 2021 GOA skate assessment.

It appears that a larger proportion of skate mortality in the GOA comes from fishing mortality rather than predation. Therefore, the highest priority research should continue to focus on direct fishing effects. It is also important to continue research on the productive capacity of skate populations, including information on age, growth, maturity, fecundity, and habitat associations.
